API reference
=============

.. _data_api:

Area Weighted
--------------
Area weighted approaches use the area of overlap between the source and target geometries to weight the 
variables being assigned to the target

.. currentmodule:: tobler.area_weighted

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

    area_interpolate


Dasymetric
-----------------------

Dasymetric approaches use auxiliary data in addition to use the area of overlap between the source and target geometries to weight the 
variables being assigned to the target

.. currentmodule:: tobler.dasymetric

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   masked_area_interpolate


Model
---------
Model based approaches use additional spatial data, such as a land cover raster, to estimate the relationships between population
and the auxiliary data. It then uses that model to predict population levels at different scales
